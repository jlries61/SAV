# SAV
Single Allocated Vote: A new system of proportional representation that involves neither ranking of candidates nor voting for party lists.

The official documentation for the project is sav.html.  The author is John L. Ries (john@theyarnbard.com).
At the present time, the only Pascal compiler that is known to compile the source files is GNU Pascal (http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/h-index.html), but an early goal of the project is to allow compilation with Free Pascal.
