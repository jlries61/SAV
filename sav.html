  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p><dfn>SAV</dfn> stands for <dfn>Single Allocated Vote</dfn>, a form of
    <a href="#proprep">proportional representation</a> developed by John L. Ries, beginning around
    1995. It is a variant of <a href="#STV">Single Transferable Vote (STV)</a> that does not involve
    ranking of candidates by voters. Instead, each voter selects as many candidates as he likes
    (regardless of the number of seats to be filled) without ranking them. The number of
    persons voting for each candidate will be used to determine the ranking. Thus, each person's
    vote will be credited to the most popular candidate voted for, who actually needs that vote to
    get elected. The number of votes required for election is the <dfn>Droop Quota</dfn>, which is
    equal to the number of persons voting in the election divided by one more than the number of
    seats to be filled (rounded down to the nearest unit), plus one.</p>

  <p>The program SAV is an implementation of this algorithm.</p>

  <a name="Download" id="Download"/>
  <h2>Where do I get it?</h2>

  <p>SAV is available on <a href="https://github.com/jlries61/SAV">Github</a>.
  </p>

  <a name="Installation" id="Installation"></a>
  <h2>How do I install it?</h2><a name="SysReq" id="SysReq"></a>

  <h3>System Requirements</h3>

  <p>The program is written in Pascal and thus far has only been
  compiled with the <a href="http://www.gnu-pascal.org">GNU Pascal
  Compiler (GPC)</a> under Linux. A makefile is provided which
  should work on any UNIX or Linux system that has GPC installed.
  I may make binaries available for selected platforms, should I feel so
  inclined.  Since SAV does compile under GPC, it should be easily portable
  to any platform supported by GCC (just about everything current, except
  for IBM mainframes).</p>

  <p>I recently attempted a compile under Free Pascal (FPC) which failed
  miserably.  On researching the issue, I discovered that my code wasn't
  nearly as Borland compatible as I thought.  I use Borland style units, but
  I also use some Extended Pascal constructs not supported by  the Borland
  dialect.  Because the Borland dialect is the most widely used, it is
  my intent at this point to work for full Borland compatibility (as much as I
  believe in open standards), but I reserve the right to opt for Extended
  Pascal compliance instead.  Either way, my goal is to allow easy compilation
  on as many platforms as possible, and in any event, SAV will remain fully
  GPC-compatible for the forseeable future.</p>
  <a name="Build" id="Build"></a>

  <h3>Building From Source Code</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Edit the makefile to taste.</li>

    <li>Type "make"</li>

    <li>If it works, you should get an executable named "sav" (or
    sav.exe on DOS/Windows). Try running the program without arguments; 
    you should get a useful help message.</li>
  </ol><a name="Install" id="Install"></a>

  <h3>Installing the SAV executable</h3>

  <p>This is very easy: just copy the executable into a directory
  in the path like /usr/local/bin. You will probably want to
  set the permissions so that everyone can execute it.</p><a name=
  "WhyPascal" id="WhyPascal"></a>

  <h3>Why is it written in Pascal?</h3>

  <p>Because it makes for more readible code, and is less prone to
  obscure bugs than is C/C++. While it means that quite a few
  people would have to install a Pascal compiler in order to build
  from source code, I anticipate that in the future, GPC will be
  included in the GCC distribution and will thus be more readily
  available. If not, I can always rewrite SAV in Ada
  :-).</p><a name="Use" id="Use"></a>

  <h2>How do I use it?</h2><a name="Quickstart" id=
  "Quickstart"></a>

  <h3>Quickstart</h3>

  <p>The help message, which is displayed if SAV runs without
  arguments, is as follows:</p>
  <pre>

SAV 1.0
Tabulates and prints election results according to
Single Allocatable Vote (SAV).

Usage:
sav &lt;control deck&gt; &lt;vote file&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The control deck will be a text file. The first line
  will contain the number of seats to be filled, followed by the
  runoff field, which will be 1 if a runoff is permitted, and 0
  otherwise. The remaining lines will contain the names of
  the candidates, one per line in the order of the indices used in
  the vote file.</p>

  <p>The vote file will be a text file, with one vote per
  line. Each vote record will consist of the indices of the
  candidates voted for, delimited by spaces.</p><a name=
  "ControlDeck" id="ControlDeck"></a>

  <h3>The Control Deck</h3>

  <p>The control deck contains the specifications for the election.
  As stated above, the first line contains the number of seats to
  be filled and a runoff indicator. The remaining lines contain the
  candidates running (one line per candidate). An example, with
  fifteen candidates competing for five seats, follows:</p>
  <pre>
5 1
Aaron Aargau (Air)
Betty Beltran (Air)
Charles Carney (Air)
Daniel Davis (Air)
Earl Effingham (Air)
Fred Feldt (Fire)
Gregory George (Fire)
Henry Higgins (Fire)
Issac Ireland (Fire)
John Jones (Fire)
Kevin Klein (Water)
Lawrence Land (Water)
Mary Mullen (Water)
Norman Nash (Water)
Orville Offenbach (Water)
</pre>

  <p>The record for each candidate can include party affiliation
  and whatever other data are required, but all are treated as part
  of the name. SAV does not use candidates' party
  affiliations to determine allocation of seats.</p>

  <p>The "1" after the "5" in the first row indicates that a runoff
  will be required if fewer candidates receive the minimum number
  of votes required for election than there are seats to be
  filled. In this case, twice as many candidates will qualify
  for the runoff (if there are that many left) as there are seats
  remaining to be filled. Not surprisingly, the top vote
  getters not elected outright will be qualify for the runoff.</p>

  <p>Should the runoff field be set to "0", any seats remaining to
  be filled will be awarded to the top remaining
  vote-getters. It is anticipated that the more seats there
  are to be filled and the less fragmented the electorate, the less
  necessary runoffs would be.</p><a name="VoteFile" id=
  "VoteFile"></a>

  <h3>The Vote File</h3>

  <p>The vote file is a text file, will one vote record per
  line. Each vote record will consist of the indeces of the
  candidates voted for, delimited by spaces. Each candidate's
  index is determined by the position of his name in the control
  deck, thus, if the sample control deck were used, Aaron Aargau is
  candidate number 1, Betty Beltran is candidate number 2,
  etc. The indices can appear in any order on the line, as
  they are unranked.</p>

  <p>First few lines of an example vote file:</p>
  <pre>
4 2 1 5 14 11 9 6
11 10 14 4 3 2
1 5 2
10 4 3
</pre>

  <p>In this example, the first voter selected Daniel Davis (4),
  Betty Beltran (2), Aaron Aargau (1), Earl Effingham (5), Norman
  Nash (14), Kevin Klein (11), Isaac Ireland (9) and Fred Feldt
  (6). The next voter selected Klein (11), John Jones (10),
  Nash (14), Davis (4), Charles Carney (3), and Beltran (2).
  Both of the first two voters selected more candidates than there
  are seats to be filled; the next two selected fewer. In any
  case, each voter has only a single vote which will be credited to
  only one of the candidates for whom he voted; the fewer
  candidates voted for, the more limited the choice. Blank
  votes are ignored. Voting for all candidates has the same
    practical effect as voting for none (except that a vote
    is ultimately credited to a candidate).</p><a name="Results" id=
  "Results"></a>

  <h3>Results</h3>

  <p>To run with ctldeck.txt as the control deck, and votes1.txt as
  the vote file, SAV would be invoked from the command prompt as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
$ sav ctldeck.txt votes1.txt
</pre>

  <p>SAV automatically assigns and tabulates the votes, producing a
  table like the following:</p>
  <pre>

Number of seats to fill: 5
Number of votes cast: 8963
Election Quota: 1494

                     Candidate    Raw vote  Allocation    Status

          Issac Ireland (Fire)        3031        1494         *
          Henry Higgins (Fire)        2998        1369         +
          Charles Carney (Air)        2993         854         +
         Gregory George (Fire)        2974         575         +
           Mary Mullen (Water)        2963         407         +
     Orville Offenbach (Water)        2958         306
              Fred Feldt (Fire)       2937         263
            Daniel Davis (Air)        2935         175
          Earl Effingham (Air)        2934         134
         Lawrence Land (Water)        2932         113
           Betty Beltran (Air)        2927         105
           Kevin Klein (Water)        2902          96
            Aaron Aargau (Air)        2879          84
% votes cast for winning candidates: 67.77

*Elected
+Qualified for runoff
</pre>

  <p>The <dfn>raw vote</dfn> is the number of persons voting for the given
  candidate. The <dfn>allocation</dfn> is the number of votes credited to
  that candidate. The sum of the allocations will always be
  equal to the number of persons voting.</p>

  <p>In this example, three candidates: Nash, Jones, and Ireland,
  are elected outright. The next four candidates, Higgins,
  Carney, George, and Mullen qualify for a runoff to fill the
  remaining two seats. When conducting the runoff, votes are
  scored in the same way as in the general election, except that
  the runoff flag is set to 0. The new control deck would be
  as follows:</p>
  <pre>
2 0
Henry Higgins (Fire)
Charles Carney (Air)
Gregory George (Fire)
Mary Mullen (Water)
</pre>

  <p>And the runoff results might look something like the
  following:</p>
  <pre>
Number of seats to fill: 2
Number of votes cast: 9190
Election Quota: 3064

                     Candidate    Raw vote  Allocation    Status
          Charles Carney (Air)        4934        3342         *
         Gregory George (Fire)        4934        3114         *
          Henry Higgins (Fire)        4925        1870
           Mary Mullen (Water)        4871         864
% votes cast for winning candidates: 81.03

*Elected
</pre>

  <p>In the first example, if the runoff flag had been set to 0,
  the top five finishers would have been elected outright.
  You will notice that the fourth place finisher in the initial
  balloting (Higgins) ends up losing the runoff to both Carney, and
  George, who finished fourth and fifth (respectively) in the
  initial balloting, but first and second in the
  runoff.</p><a name="TechSupport" id="TechSupport"></a>

  <h3>Technical Support</h3>

  <p>For now, I am willing to answer queries by e-mail (See my
  <a href="https://github.com/jlries61">Github profile</a>).
  Should the volume become too great, I may consider starting a
  mailing list or forum. Not surprisingly, paid consulting gigs and
  my regular job both get priority over free support.
  Details are often important; clarity always is.
  The easier you make it for me to help you, the prompter
  the help is likely to be.</p><a name="Algorithm" id="Algorithm"></a>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2><a name="InitTab" id="InitTab"></a>

  <h3>Initial Tabulation</h3>

  <p>Since the raw vote totals are used to determine the ranking of
  candidates, the first step is to count the number of persons
  voting for each candidate and the number of persons voting in the
  election. These are used to calculate the Droop quota,
  which is the number of votes required for
  election:</p><code>Quota:=(NVotes div (NSeats+1))+1;</code>

  <p>which is the minimum number of votes necessary to insure that
  it is mathematically impossible for more candidates to be elected
  than there are seats to be filled. In the event of an
  election for a single seat, the quota will be an absolute
  majority (50%+1) of the persons voting.</p><a name="Alloc1" id=
  "Alloc1"></a>

  <h3>First Allocation</h3>

  <p>The next step is to allocate each of the votes cast to a
  single candidate. This will be the candidates voted for
  with the largest raw vote, that has not yet reached quota, and
  thus has already been elected. If all candidates voted for
  have reached quota, the vote will be allocated to whichever one
  has the largest raw vote.</p>

  <p>Ties are currently broken in favor of the candidate that
  appears first in the control deck. It is anticipated that
  in the future, ties will be broken by a random draw, but at
  present, the order of candidates in the control deck can be
  randomized, if desired. In any event, ties are highly
  unlikely, unless the number of persons voting is small.</p>

  <p>If, after this initial allocation, as many candidates reach
  quota as there are seats to be filled, they are declared elected
  and no more processing need take place.</p><a name="Alloc2" id=
  "Alloc2"></a>

  <h3>Second Allocation</h3>

  <p>If not all seats are filled, the next step is to transfer
  votes from those candidates who have already achieved quota to
  those that have not. This is done by sorting the candidates
  in order of allocation and then transferring votes (if possible)
  from the candidate with the highest allocation who has already
  reached quota, to the candidate voted for with the highest raw
  vote that has not yet reached quota (if any). The
  candidates are re-sorted after each transfer. The process
  stops when either all seats are filled, or there are no more
  votes that can be transfered.</p><a name="FinalAlloc" id=
  "FinalAlloc"></a>

  <h3>Final Allocation</h3>

  <p>If, after the first two allocations, there are still seats
  remaining to be filled, the next step is to transfer as many
  votes as possible from the candidates with the smallest
  allocations to the candidates with larger allocations that have
  not yet reached quota. This is done by "eliminating" the
  candidate still under consideration with the smallest allocation
  and then transferring as many votes as possible from that
  candidate to the candidate voted for with the highest raw vote
  that has not yet either reached quota, or been eliminated.
  If no more votes can be transferred from that candidate, the
  candidate with the next smallest allocation is eliminated and the
  process continues. The process ends when either all seats
  have been filled, or all candidates have either reached quota or
  been eliminated.</p><a name="AwardSeats" id="AwardSeats"></a>

  <h3>Awarding of Seats</h3>

  <p>Seats are awarded to the candidates that have reached
  quota. If, after processing is complete, there are still
  fewer candidates elected than there are seats to be filled,
  either the remaining candidates with the largest allocations can
  simply be declared elected without a runoff, or a runoff can be
  held between the remaining candidates (up to twice as many as
  there are seats remaining to be filled) with the largest
  allocations. Ties in either event are, at this point,
  resolved first in favor of the candidates with the largest
  numbers of raw votes, and then in favor the candidates first
  listed in the control deck. A random draw may be
  implemented instead in later versions of the program.</p>

  <p>For informational purposes, the percentage of those voting who
  selected one or more winning candidates is calculated and
  displayed. This will almost always be higher than if the
  seats were awarded in accordance to plurality, usually much
  higher, unless the number of seats contested is small (ie. one or
  two).</p><a name="Why" id="Why"></a>

  <h2>Why would I want to use it anyway?</h2><a name="TrueProp" id=
  "TrueProp"></a>

  <h3>It is truly proportional.</h3>

  <p>Unlike pseudo-proportional systems such as <a href=
  "#cumvote">cumulative voting</a>, or <a href=
  "#incomplete_list">incomplete list systems</a>, SAV guarantees
  that seats will be awarded to competing parties or factions
  roughly in proportion to their support among the
  electorate. Unlike winner-take-all systems (including
  <a href="#plurality">plurality</a> systems, such as those used 
  in the US, Canada and the
  UK), SAV makes it nearly impossible for any faction to win a
  majority in an elective body without majority support (barring
  unequally apportioned constituencies). Plurality voting allows
  a party or faction to win a majority with as little
  as one third of the vote, if the opposition is severely
  fragmented.</p><a name="HowProp" id="HowProp"></a>

  <h4>How is it proportional?</h4>

  <p>Caveat: It is not, unless the number of seats per <a href=
  "#constituency">constituency</a> (district) is sufficiently
  high.</p>

  <p>SAV, like <a href="#STV">Single Transferrable Vote (STV)</a>,
  seeks to evenly divide the electorate among as many candidates as
  there are seats to be filled. Since each voter has a single
  vote, the votes credited to each candidate represent (in theory)
  a different segment of the electorate.</p><a name="NonPartisan"
  id="NonPartisan"></a>

  <h3>It is Officially Non-Partisan.</h3>

  <p>SAV completely ignores party affiliations of candidates.
  This allows voters to divide their votes among candidates of
  competing parties as they see fit. It also allows
  independent candidates to compete on the same basis as partisan
  ones. SAV can even be used in officially non-partisan
  elections, and will award seats among whatever factions (to
  include social classes and religious and ethnic groupings) divide
  the voting population, even if they cut across formal party
  groupings, and even if formal party groupings do not exist.
  It is even appropriate for use by clubs, corporations, and other
  private organizations where party affiliation is, or should be
  irrelevant.</p><a name="Dispolar" id="Dispolar"></a>

  <h3>It Discourages Polarization.</h3>

  <p>By awarding votes to the candidates with the broadest support
  in each faction, SAV rewards efforts to appeal to voters across
  party and factional lines. Conversely, candidates with
  narrow bases of support are penalized. This is in contrast
  to <a href="#STV">STV (Single Transferrable Vote)</a>, which
  tends to favor the candidates within each faction with the most
  enthusiastic followings, and <a href="#closed_list">party list
  systems</a>, which tend to reward party loyalty and divide the
  electorate along party lines, discouraging cooperation between
  politicians and voters of different factions on matters where
  they agree, except as necessary to secure majority support for a
  given proposal, which is often difficult.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, <a href="#plurality">plurality</a> at-large
  systems, which are often used in local government, often increase
  polarization by making it possible to shut out the opposition,
  thus putting a premium on cut-throat tactics. SAV, by
  making it more difficult to shut out minority factions, will tend
  to reduce the motivation for cut-throat politics, thus allowing
  politicians and voters with differing opinions to more peacefully
  coexist.</p><a name="Account" id="Account"></a>

  <h3>It Makes Politicians Individually Accountable To the
  Voters.</h3>

  <p>Since voting is for individual candidates, instead of for
  party slates, candidates are directly accountable to the voters,
  instead of being primarily accountable to their parties.
  The biggest problem with slate voting is that it makes elected
  officials more accountable to their parties than they are to the
  voters they theoretically represent. The problem is
  compounded by <a href="#closed_list">closed list systems</a> that
  allow parties to order the candidates by preference, thus
  rewarding party loyalty and seniority, and making the individuals
  elected almost completely unaccountable to the general
  public.</p><a name="Gerrymandering" id="Gerrymandering"></a>

  <h3>It is Resistant to Gerrymandering</h3>

  <p>In common with other proportional systems, if the number of
  seats per <a href="#constituency">constituency</a> is
  sufficiently large (perhaps 5-7), seats will be awarded to parties 
  or factions
  in proportion to their support among the electorate, frustrating
  efforts to rig elections in favor of one faction or another
  through the creative drawing of election districts (often a
  danger with majority or plurality systems.</p><a name=
  "SimpleAdmin" id="SimpleAdmin"></a>

  <h3>It is Simple to Administer.</h3>

  <p>Balloting takes place in the same way as in a <a href=
  "#plurality">plurality</a> election, except that no limit on the
  number of candidates voted for need be imposed. Elections
  conducted on the basis of <a href="#STV">single transferable
  voting (STV)</a> require voters to rank the candidates, and it
  often takes days before results are known. Assuming that
  ballots are in a form that is easy to scan electronically,
  votes could be
  rapidly read for processing by SAV, and results published the
  same day.</p><a name="twoparty" id="twoparty"></a>

  <h3>Won't This Undermine the Two Party System?</h3>

  <p>Maybe. <a href="#plurality">Plurality</a> voting systems
  strongly discriminate against independent and minor party
  candidates. Voters are discouraged from supporting such
  candidates on the theory that they "can't win", and that any
  votes for them are "wasted". On the other hand, I doubt
  that a two party system that survives only through intimidation
  is really worth having. Furthermore, there is nothing in
  SAV that prevents the electorate from voting overwhelmingly for
  major party candidates, should that be their true
  inclination.</p>

  <p>In addition, plurality voting systems are not always enough to
  prevent the splintering of the electorate among multiple
  parties. Although one party almost always wins a majority
  of seats in the British House of Commons (and thus, the privilege
  of forming the government), that party almost never has majority
  support among the electorate. Indeed, while the
  Conservative and Labour Parties together normally win the vast
  majority of the seats, and even a comfortable majority of the
  votes, the Liberal Party (now the Liberal Democratic Party) has
  always attracted considerable support and at least a few seats
  (now a substantial number). In addition, regional parties
  now command the support of a growing number of voters and win
  increasing numbers of seats. All this is true in spite of
  the fact that elections are conducted by plurality voting in
  single member constituencies. The same trend is occuring in
  Canada, where four parties now routinely win seats in the House
  of Commons, despite the fact that members are elected by
  plurality vote from single member constituencies. As of
  this writing (April, 2009), the last three federal Parliamentary
  elections in Canada have resulted in minority governments.</p>

  <p>Even in the USA, candidates are sometimes elected over the
  opposition of most voters because the opposition is
  divided. Elected officials chosen on this basis often enjoy
  less legitimacy in the eyes of voters than those with majority
  support, and are therefore often less effective.
  Furthermore, I suspect that efforts to win elections by dividing
  the opposition, instead of by winning majority support, tend to
  undermine public confidence in elections, thus alienating the
  people, without whose support representative government is
  impossible. Again, even in the USA, it is becoming more
  common for no candidate to win a popular majority in the
  presidential election, due largely to increased dissatisfaction
  with the major parties. In three of the last five US
  presidential elections (1992-2008), the winning candidate was
  elected with less than a majority of the popular vote.</p>

  <p>Another problem that often occurs in single member
  constituency systems is that many constituencies are "safe" for
  one party or another. In such cases, the nomination of the
  dominant party is tantamount to election, discouraging voter
  participation and reducing accountability. In addition, the
  once disreputable practice of gerrymandering has gained great
  favor in the USA in recent years. As of the time of this
  writing, election districts for the US Congress and state
  Legislature in California are so drawn as to virtually insure the
  election of the candidate of a particular party in nearly all of
  them. This was deliberately done to minimize the possiblity
  of seats shifting from one party to another.</p><a name=
  "Effect" id="Effect"></a>

  <h3>What would this do to my party?</h3>

  <p>My prediction and hope would be that replacing a majoritarian
  electoral system with SAV would make it much more difficult for a
  dominant party to retain that status in the long term (either
  globally or locally). It would also be my expectation that it
  would tend to relax party discipline by making candidates less
  dependent on their parties to win election. As noted above, any
  system of proportional representation would also make it easier
  for candidates of smaller parties to be elected, which would make
  it more difficult to maintain a two party duopoly such as the
  Democratic/Republican rivalry that has dominated US politics
  since the 1850s.  It would also be my expectation that it 
  would make it more difficult to exclude candidates representing ethnic
  or religious minorities from serious consideration, even in the
  face of major party collusion.</p>

  <p>That said, how well a particular party would do under SAV
  would be largely dependent on its ability to win and maintain the
  confidence of voters. To the extent that people trust a
  particular party to promote the public interest, that party will
  have an easier time winning election of its candidates and
  adoption of its policies, than otherwise. To the extent that
  parties rely on being the "only game in town", or the only
  realistic alternative to the "Bad Guys", they will tend to suffer
  under a system that affords voters a wider variety of viable
  candidates. Smaller parties will tend to do better under
  proportional representation than under a majoritarian system, but
  the degree will depend on their ability to win the confidence and
  allegiance of mainstream voters and the ability of major parties
  to "hold their own".</p><a name="WhyProp" id="WhyProp"></a>

  <h3>Why are you in favor of proportional representation?</h3>

  <p>I am not, entirely. I think there is much to be said for
  majority voting, particularly the fact that it forces candidates
  to appeal to the majority of the electorate, rather than to a
  narrow fraction. Majority voting is also a lot simpler and
  more intuitive than are most systems of proportional
  representation, and makes it easier to hold individual
  politicians accountable than does any system of proportional
  representation, SAV included. Combined with single member
  constituencies, it greatly reduces the number of elected
  officials of whom voters need to keep track, allowing such voters
  to make more informed judgments regarding individual
  politicians.</p>

  <p>That said, I think a <em>nonpartisan</em> system of
  proportional representation, such as SAV, offers a number of
  advantages, especially when the electorate is polarized on party,
  class, regional, or ethnic lines, or in situations where one
  party is dominant. I think SAV would be an enormous
  improvement over the plurality at-large system typically employed
  in municipal elections, or the plurality multimember consituency
  system employed in elections to some state legislative bodies
  (such as the New Hampshire House of Representatives). As
  noted before, proportional systems are resistant to
  gerrymandering, and make it easier to elect representatives on a
  the basis of natural regional groupings, rather than from
  arbitrary constituencies for which numerical equality is the
  primary, and sometimes the only basis.</p>

  <p>Possibly, it would make sense to elect one house of a
  bicameral legislature from single member constuencies by majority
  vote (instead of plurality), and the other on a regional basis
  using SAV, or to elect a unicameral assembly partly one way, and
  partly the other. In any event, SAV should be seen as one
  of a variety of methods that might or might not be appropriate
  depending on the circumstances, rather than as the optimal system
  in all cases. It is one tool in the toolbox, not a magic
  bullet.</p><a name="Parties" id="Parties"></a>

  <h3>What is wrong with political parties?</h3>

  <p>Having read this far, you might get the impression that I am
  less than sympathetic to partisan politics and you would be
  correct. I wrote an essay several years ago in which I
  discussed at length the reasons for this aversion. Suffice
  it to say here that I view political parties as unnecessary
  intermediaries between the people and their elected leaders, that
  they enforce false dichotomies by packaging together sets of
  political beliefs and policies that may or may not be related to each other,
  that they encourage emnity between people who might otherwise be
  encouraged to cooperate on matters of common concern, that they
  too often put the effort to win elections ahead of the public
  interest (often engaging in corrupt practices or tolerating
  corrupt officials), and far too often, have (deliberately or not)
  restricted freedom of thought and conscience by making conformity
  to a predetermined orthodoxy the price for meaningful
  participation in the political system (if not for retaining one's
  employment, staying out of prison, or maybe even staying
  alive). Political parties may be inevitable (or not) in a
  system of government based on free elections, but at their best,
  they are advocacy organizations formed by groups of like minded
  citizens for the purpose of promoting particular policies and
  candidates for public office. This role does not require
  that they control the nomination of candidates for office, that
  parliamentary bodies be organized along party lines, or that
  executives make party affiliation or loyalty leading criteria for
  appointing or dismissing their subordinates. Let parties make
  such recommendations to voters and elected officials as they
  think best, and then allow them to follow their own consciences
  without fear of recrimination. Parties do not need and should
  not have a formal role in either the nomination of candidates or
  in the operation of governmental institutions, which should
  represent all citizens, instead of just the majority party or
  coalition.</p><a name="Free" id="Free"></a>

  <h2>Why are you giving it away?</h2>

  <p>While I believe that it is appropriate (though certainly not
  mandatory) to sell most software on a proprietary basis, software
  that performs sensitive public functions (like scoring elections)
  requires a degree of public confidence that can only be achieved
  by opening the source code to public inspection. The use of
  open source software to score elections eliminates a major
  potential source of election fraud, error, and controversy.
  Such will always be a danger with closed source software, no
  matter how honest the developer, or the administrator.</p>

  <p>In addition, my primary purpose in writing this program is to
  present the SAV algorithm to the public. Widespread
  adoption, or at least, discussion of this algorithm is, in this
  case, sufficient reward for my efforts, though monetary
  contributions will certainly not be refused.</p><a name="Todos"
  id="Todos"></a>

  <h2>What remains to be done?</h2><a name="Testing" id=
  "Testing"></a>

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <p>The "right way" to test this algorithm and to assess its
  impact on elections where it is used, would be to test it on real
  election data. The problem is that combinations of votes
  cast in previous elections are rarely, if ever, saved,
  particularly here in the USA, where nearly all elections are
  decided by either plurality or majority vote. I have
  created some artificial data sets, which attempt to simulate
  voting with varying degrees of partisanship. Not
  surprisingly, where party loyalty is weak and ticket splitting
  endemic, results tend to be similar to those obtained by
  plurality voting. As partisanship becomes stronger, results
  look more like those associated with free list proportional
  representation. That is what I expect.</p> 

  <p>One line of research I intend to pursue is to determine the extent
     to which the order in which votes are counted affects the results.  I 
     expect the effect to be minor, particularly if the number of votes is
     large, but if it is significant, then steps would need to be taken to
     mitigate it.</p>

  <p>Results from previous elections in California (and presumably
  other states) are available aggregated by precinct. Such
  data could be used to create artificial voting data with
  by-candidate totals matching those recorded. Such data
  could be constructed with varying assumptions about the level of
  partisanship. I have not attempted to use such data, but I
  hope to do so in the near future.</p>

  <p>Should "real" data be available somewhere (maybe from STV
  jurisdictions like Ireland or Australia), I would love to try SAV
  on them. Such real data could also include results from
  elections to the governing board of your favorite club or
  volunteer organization.</p>

  <p>Someday, should I have time to test SAV adequately, I might
  even publish a paper on my findings. In the meantime, I
  would love to read any research others might do.</p><a name=
  "Weights" id="Weights"></a>

  <h3>Weighted Voting.</h3>

  <p>For better or worse, voting in for-profit corporations is
  conducted on a weighted basis, each voter typically having as
  many votes as he has shares of stock. I believe that
  corporations could benefit by affording a broader range of
  stockholder representation on their boards than is now usually
  done (interest in such things even crops up in the news
  occasionally). Since, under the usual winner-take-all
  system, corporate boards are nominated by a controlling faction,
  and ratified by the stockholders with little or no opposition, it
  is easy for such boards to become rubber stamps for management,
  which they often are. A more broadly representative board
  of directors could more effectively supervise the management, and
  could insure that minority concerns are at least discussed.
  Such could be true, even if one person has a controlling
  interest. The majority still wins, but at least the
  minority gets to participate in the discussion.</p><a name=
  "Writein" id="Writein"></a>

  <h3>Write-in Votes.</h3>

  <p>It should be possible to write in the names of persons for
  whom one wishes to vote, either because none of the ones listed
  are acceptable, or others are deemed more suitable. This
  could be done by allowing a write-in code (maybe the number of
  official candidates, plus one) in the vote file, to be followed
  by the name of the person "written in".</p><a name="none" id=
  "none"></a>

  <h3>"None of the Above".</h3>

  <p>While desire to vote for "none of the above" is symptomatic of
  insufficiently competitive elections, and should be lessened by
  the greater competition afforded by systems such as SAV, it may
  still be a good idea to offer the option as a way to "keep the
  big boys honest". Under SAV, a vote for "none of the above"
  (probably represented by a zero), combined with no votes for
  actual candidates, would increase the number of votes cast,
  without increasing the number of votes recorded for actual
  candidates. This would have the effect of raising the quota
  and thus making it harder to win election outright. If
  "none of the above" were to receive enough votes to reach quota
  (assuming a single round election), a proportionate number of
  seats would be declared vacant, and a new election would have to
  be called to fill them, from which all candidates running in the
  current election would be disqualified. In a two round
  election, greater numbers of "none of the above" votes would make
  it more difficult for the leading candidates to reach quota, but
  the candidates qualifying for the runoff would have an additional
  opportunity to win over dissaffected voters before seats are
  declared vacant, or existing candidates are disqualified.
  Of course, a "none of the above" vote should be ignored, if
  combined with votes for existing candidates</p>

  <p>In general, it is much more constructive for voters who fail
  to find at least one suitable candidate on the ballot, or to
  write in the names of one or more persons they do find suitable,
  than it is for them to simply reject all candidates
  outright. Thus, the penalty for large numbers of people
  voting for "none of the above" should be a proportionate number
  of seats being left vacant, pending a new election. That way, a
  vote for "none of the above" could be properly interpreted as
  preferring one or more vacancies to the election of any of the
  existing candidates.</p><a name="Ties" id="Ties"></a>

  <h3>Resolution of Tie Votes.</h3>

  <p>I expect ties to be rare, but not unheard of. At
  present, ties are resolved by ranking candidates in the order
  they appear in the control deck. A random ordering could be
  used instead, or a random draw could be made at the time the tie
  occurs. There may be other possibilities.</p><a name="FUI"
  id="FUI"></a>

  <h3>Friendlier User Interface.</h3>

  <p>The existing command line interface is portable, relatively
  easy to program, and easily incorporated into scripts, but
  interactive, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have become the
  standard. Indeed, most computer users now have little or no
  experience with command lines or scripting, and are comfortable
  only with a GUI. A GUI front end with the ability to
  specify candidates and parameters, and possibly even to enter the
  votes, might well be helpful for such users.</p><a name=
  "EffAssign" id="EffAssign"></a>

  <h3>More Efficient Assignment.</h3>

  <p>It may be possible to reduce or eliminate the need for
  re-assignment of votes if they are sorted properly. One
  idea is, after tabulating the raw votes, sorting the votes in
  reverse order of the popularity of the candidates voted
  for. Thus, votes cast only for the least popular candidate
  would go first, followed by votes only for the second least
  popular candidate, followed by votes for both of the two least
  popular candidates, etc. Votes cast for all candidates
  (assignable to any of them) would go last. Another
  possibility would be to rank in ascending order of the number of
  candidates selected (singleton votes first). In either
  case, the least flexible votes are allocated first. There
  may be other sorting orders that would work better.</p><a name=
  "OtherIdeas" id="OtherIdeas" />

  <h3>How to Fill Vacancies.</h3>
  <p>
  While it is certainly possible to fill vacancies by simply holding a special
  election, it would, in all likelihood, throw proportionality out the window.
  Therefore, it seems a good idea to devise a mechanism for filling vacancies
  more in keeping with the spirit of SAV.  One possibility would be
  to recount the ballots from the previous election with the person whose
  removal caused the vacancy, plus any other no-longer-eligible candidates
  disqualified.  Votes for candidates elected and currently serving would be
  counted and credited as they were before.  The purpose of this would be
  to simulate as closely as possible the previous election as it would have
  been if the departed members and other now-inelligble persons had not been
  candidates.  If one of the previously unsuccessful candidates reaches quota,
  he/she would be declared elected, otherwise, a special election could be
  held between the two candidates not previously elected that have the largest
  allocations.  In the latter case, it may be necessary to require a minimum
  number of raw votes to be eligible (maybe quota or a large fraction thereof).
  If the vacant seat cannot be filled in either of those fashions, an "open"
  special election could be held.  To accomodate such recounts, it would be
  useful to be able to instruct SAV to ignore certain candidates, so as to not
  have to modify the vote file.</p>

  <p>A third possibility would be to declare an alternate for each person
    elected who would be the candidate not elected with the most votes in
    common with the one who was (the same person might end up serving
    as an alternate to multiple members).  If for whatever reason, the person
    originally elected did not finish his term, the alternate would serve
    for the remainder.  This would have the advantage of not requiring a
    special election and being easier to compute than a full rerun of the
    vote counting.</p>

    <dt>Proportional Representation</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>One of a class of election systems designed to choose
      candidates from different parties or other fractions of the
      electorate in proportion to the number of votes their
      candidates received. Western European and Latin
      American parliamentary elections almost always employ some
      form of proportional representation in multimember
      constituencies (or at large), sometimes mixed with plurality or
      majority voting in single member constituencies. Such
      systems are more representative of public opinion overall
      than are majoritarian ones, but usually at the cost of
      political fragmentation, increased partisanship, and reduced
      individual accountability of those elected (which SAV is
      designed to minimize). In most representative bodies
      chosen by proportional representation, it is rare for any one
      party to hold a majority of the seats, requiring parties to
      form coalitions in order to govern effectively, or even to
      pass controversial legislation (due to increased
      partisanship).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="plurality" id="plurality"></a>Plurality Voting</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The practice of declaring elected the candidate(s) with
      the largest number of votes, even if supported by only a
      minority of voters. This is most common in English
      speaking countries, but is also frequently used
      elsewhere. It effectively discourages voting for
      candidates deemed unlikely to win plurality support, thus
      discouraging political splintering, but also often leading to
      rule by the largest or best organized minority, rather than
      by the majority. Plurality voting is most often done in
      constituencies where only one person is elected at a time,
      but is also sometimes employed in multimember constituencies,
      and often at large, such as in US municipal council
      elections. Plurality voting systems usually require
      that voters select no more candidates than there are seats to
      be filled, but this is not strictly necessary, and systems
      allowing votes for more candidates than there are seats to be
      filled have been proposed as a way of promoting the election
      of those candidates in whom the public has the most
      confidence.</p>

      <p>
        <dfn>"First past the post" (FFTP)</dfn> is the practice
        of electing one candidate (or slate of candidates) per constituency
        at a time by plurality vote, each voter being permitted to vote for
        only one candidate (or slate).  Under <dfn>Block Voting</dfn>,
        there are multiple seats to be filled, each person beling allowed
        to vote for as many candidates as there are seats to be filled,
        and the candidates with the most votes being declared elected.
        Block voting is typically employed in electing US state and territorial
        legislators from multimember constituencies, as well as in choosing
        US municipal councillors at large.
        </p>

      <p>US Presidential Electors are, in nearly all states and in
      the District of Columbia, elected as slates of candidates
      pledged to vote for a particular pairing of candidates for
      President and Vice President. The slate that wins the
      largest number of votes in a given state is normally awarded
      all that jurisdiction's Electors. The Electors then formally
      elect the President and Vice President by majority vote, but
      the result is almost always a foregone conclusion.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Majority Voting</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The practice of requiring a majority of votes for
      election. If fewer candidates win majority support than
      there are seats to be filled, a runoff is usually held
      between the highest remaining vote-getters. This is
      most common in France and eastern Europe, and in Latin
      American presidential elections. If a majority is
      required for election, voters feel more free to support their
      most preferred candidates (at least in the first round), even
      if they are deemed unlikely to win, while the sort of
      political splintering common under proportional
      representation is still discouraged, and candidates typically
      run as individuals, instead of as party slates. Unlike
      plurality voting systems, majority voting systems make it
      difficult for one party to win a majority of the seats in a
      representative assembly without majority support among the
      voting population. However, runoffs are often required,
        increasing the time and cost of administering elections.</p>

      <p>Under <dfn>Alternative Voting</dfn>, voters are permitted
        to rank the candidates in order of preference and if no
        candidate receives a majority of the first place votes,
        the votes of the least popular candidates can be transfered
        to more popular ones in accordance with the wishes of individual
        voters.  Thus, it is a special case of
        <a href="#STV"> Single Transferrable Vote</a> in which only a
        single candidate is elected per constituency.  The President
        of the Irish Republic and members of the Australian House of
        Representatives are elected in this fashion.  This procedure
        is often called <dfn>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</dfn> in the USA,
        where it is sometimes advocated as a replacement for plurality
        voting.</p>

    <dt>Incomplete voting systems (Limited Voting)</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Election systems in which voters are only allowed to
      select candidates to fill a fraction of the seats to be
      filled. There are two major variants:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Those where voters select individual candidates.
        An example is the system for electing at large members of
        the District of Columbia (Washington, DC) Council:
        Each voter selects one candidate, but the top two vote
        getters are elected (two of the four at large councillors
        are chosen every second year) and no party is permitted to
        nominate more than one at large candidate per election,
        making it impossible for any one party to hold more than
        eleven of the thirteen seats.  When voters are only
        permitted to select one candidate each, but multiple seats
        are filled, the practice is sometimes referred to as
        <dfn>Single Nontransferrable Vote (SNTV)</dfn>.
        Eleven members of each house of the Puerto Rico Legislative
        Assembly are elected at large using SNTV.
        </li>

        <li><a name="incomplete_list" id=
        "incomplete_list"></a>Those where voters select party
        slates, the one with the largest number of votes being
        granted a majority of the seats, and the one with the
        second largest number of votes usually winning the
        rest. An example is the system for electing the three
        fourths of the Mexican Senate chosen by state: Three
        senators are elected from each state, and the Federal
        District, but each party is permitted to nominate only two
        candidates, and voting is for party lists, rather than for
        individual candidates. The party with the largest
        number of votes in the given state is awarded two seats,
        while the one with the second largest number of votes wins
        the remaining seat. This practice is called an
        <dfn>incomplete list system</dfn>.</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="cumvote" id="cumvote"></a>Cumulative Voting</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>An election system in which each voter gets a single vote
      which he may divide among as many candidates (regardless of
      party) as desired, and the candidates receiving the most
      votes are elected. The normal consequence is to insure
      minority representation in each (multimember) constituency by
      making it much more difficult for one party to win all of the
      seats. At one time this was often used in local
      elections in the USA, and also in elections for the Illinois
      House of Representatives (each of the 59 legislative
      districts elected one Senator and three Representatives), but
      it has fallen out of favor. It is still used in some
      localities.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="closed_list" id="closed_list"></a>Closed List System</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A proportional representation system in which each
      political party or faction nominates a list of candidates in
      order of preference, and each voter chooses one of
      them. Seats are then awarded to each party list in
      proportion to the number of votes it received. There
      may be a minimum percentage of votes required to receive
      seats, as is the case for the one quarter of deputies to the
      German Bundestag that are elected by state, but this is not
      always the case. Extreme examples are elections to the
      Israeli Knesset (120 members elected at large), and the South
      African National Assembly (400 members elected at
      large). In neither of these two cases is a minimum
      percentage of votes required for representation, meaning that
      a party that wins 1/400 of the vote in a South African
      general election is entitled to a seat in the National
      Assembly. The closed list system is the single most common
      form of proportional representation.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Open List System</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A proportional representation system in which voters
        are permitted to select individual candidates within a party
        list. Seats are awarded to the parties in proportion to
        the votes each received, and are filled by the candidates
        from each party that win the largest numbers of votes.
        There is often a minimum percentage of votes required for
        representation. This form of proportional representation is
        common in much of continental Europe and Latin America.</p>

      <p><dfn>Free List Proportional Representation</dfn> is a
        special case of the open list system that allows voters to choose
        as many individual candidates as there are seats to be filled,
        the votes being regarded as cast for both the candidates and their
        parties.  This allows "split ticket" voting, which is generally
        precluded in list systems.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="STV" id="STV"></a>Single Transferrable Vote
    (STV)</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>A proportional representation system in which each voter
      selects one or more candidates in order of preference.
      Each vote is initally credited to the most preferred
      candidate of each voter, but can be transferred to candidates
      lower down on the list, if the more preferred candidates
      already have enough votes to win election. Typically,
      the Droop quota (the total number of votes divided by one
      more than the number of seats to be filled, plus one) is
      required to insure election. If fewer candidates "make
      quota" than there are seats to be filled, then the remaining
      candidates with the highest numbers of votes are
      declared elected. When STV is used in single member
      constituencies, it is sometimes referred to as <dfn>Instant
      Runoff Voting (IRV)</dfn> or <dfn>Alternative Voting (AV)</dfn>.
      STV in multimember constituencies is the only form of proportional
      representation in common use in which candidates run solely
      as individuals, rather than as members of a party slate.
      It is is rarely used outside of the former British Empire.</p>

      <p>STV is widely used in Ireland and Australia, and is
      traditionally advocated by the Liberal Democratic Party in
      the UK, where plurality elections are the norm. <dfn>Dail
      Eireann</dfn> (the lower house of the Irish Parliament) is elected
      by STV from multimember constituences, as is the Australian
      Senate. 45 of the 60 members of the Irish Senate
      (<dfn>Seanad Eireann</dfn>) are indirectly elected through STV
      from among panels of candidates nominated to represent different
      areas of expertise.</p>

      <p>SAV is proposed as an alternative non-partisan system of
      proportional representation and is partly based on STV.</p>
